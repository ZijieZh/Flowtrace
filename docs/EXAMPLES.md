**Run one** — ▶ *live* (the real use): tell your agent _"run this trace"_ on your own input, and it does each
node's work for real. ▷ *demo*: `bash scripts/examples/<id>/build.sh` replays a pre-recorded, illustrative
run; `flowtrace serve` opens the UI. Synthetic CLI-surface / animation demos live in
[REFERENCE-TRACES.md](trace/REFERENCE-TRACES.md).

## 📄 Career — Tailored Résumé Generator

Tailor a résumé to a job posting — parse the posting and résumé in parallel, score every bullet, rewrite the weak ones, format ATS-safe. Each judgment is a node you can point at and overrule. *Demo: a fictional candidate.*

## 💰 Investing — Comprehensive Stock Analysis

A comprehensive single-stock analysis — four data lanes (price, fundamentals, macro, news) → five analyses → a synthesized buy / hold / sell thesis → position sizing. Change one assumption and the whole chain re-evaluates. *Demo: NVDA.*

## 🤝 Corp dev / M&A — SaaS Acquisition Due Diligence

Acquisition due diligence as a DAG — four ingest streams → five C-suite lenses in parallel (run serially, the first lens's framing contaminates the rest) → a two-sided thesis → valuation → a last-but-binding compliance veto. *Demo: a fictional company, illustrative figures.*

## 🛡 Security / DevSecOps — Security CI/CD Pipeline

A PR security gate — six parallel scans → triage → red-team (ATT&CK) ∥ blue-team (Sigma/YARA) → a gate that blocks only on findings both high-severity and confirmed exploitable. Red-team runs *after* triage, not before: validating un-deduped findings burns cycles on false positives.

## ✍️ Research / writing — Industry Deep-Dive Report

Write a long-form industry report — the first node fixes audience, goal, and angle, and the ten nodes after depend on it. Edit that one judgment (say, VC investors → enterprise founders) and the outline, draft, and sections rewrite downstream.

<a id="swe-bugfix"></a>

## 🐛 Software engineering — Bug-Fix Learning Loop

A bug-fix loop — systematic-debugging's four phases → a TDD fix → two-stage review. Each run writes back the codebase-specific gotcha it found and sharpens its own STEP.md, so by the fifth run the trace knows your code — the diff visible in git log.

<a id="paid-ads"></a>

## 📈 Growth / marketing — Weekly Paid-Ads Optimization

A weekly paid-ads loop — each week's data fans into five diagnoses → a problem tree → test candidates drawn from accumulated `memory.md`. The hypothesis node starts generic and, twenty weeks in, writes brand-specific heuristics earned from real experiments — the trace becomes your playbook.

## 🧠 Knowledge / personas — Distill a Mind into a Skill

Distill a person's thinking into a reusable skill — six parallel research lanes, but only traits surviving a triple test (cross-domain ∧ predictive ∧ distinctive) reach the synthesis. Every lane cites a file, so the persona can't claim a trait that isn't on disk. *Demo: a fictional figure.*

## 🖼 Design / decks — Talk → Magazine Slide Deck

Turn raw content into a single-file HTML magazine deck — pick a visual system, build a rhythm table, select layouts while image prompts generate in parallel, assemble, self-validate. Picked Swiss for a talk that wanted editorial? Switch `choose_style` and the whole deck re-renders.

## How to write your own

Every example above is a real builder you can read end to end: `scripts/examples/<id>/template/` holds the
`trace.json` (the DAG), per-step `STEP.md` contracts, and shared `scripts/` — the same anatomy you'd author by
hand. The move that makes each one is to read a source skill's prose, pull out the steps hiding in
it, and work out how they connect — which run in parallel, which fan in. The arrows are the knowledge, so get
them right.

To turn your own source into a trace — a `SKILL.md`, a runbook, a chat log, a finished task — use the
[`make-trace`](../skills/make-trace/SKILL.md) skill: copy `skills/make-trace/` into your agent's skills directory
and run `/make-trace`. For the trace.json schema see [SCHEMA.md](trace/SCHEMA.md); for the agent-facing CLI
reference see [CLI.md](trace/CLI.md).
